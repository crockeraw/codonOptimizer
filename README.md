# codonOptimizer 
This tool evaluates coding sequences and returns a dictionary or CSV of codon preferences.  

It can also accept a gene file and return a codon optimized version of the same sequence.  

An example case for its use is provided, and compares the codon preferences of two fungi, *Aureobassidium pullulans* and *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.
